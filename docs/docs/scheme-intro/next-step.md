# What Next

If you want to learn more about Scheme, these are the resources I recommend:

## Scheme

* [Sketchy Scheme](https://www.t3x.org/sketchy/) by [Nils M Holm](https://www.t3x.org/)

![Sketchy Scheme Book Cover](./img/sketchy-scheme.png)

There is free version in Archive.org called [Sketchy Lisp](https://archive.org/details/sketchy-lisp) but I recommend latest version.

* [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf)

A classic, one of the authors of the book is the author of Scheme language.

I also recommend video lectures. There are two versions. I recommend orignal by Abelson and Sussman from 1986.

[![SICP MIT Lectures](./img/SICP-lectures.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB63C06FAF154F047)

This is [offical website of the lectures](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/).

They are not very good quality, but they are great and you should have no problems in seeing the code on the blackboard.

There are also more recent lectures from 2010 at [Berkley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) by [Brian Harvey](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/).
Only a little bit better quality.

## Lisp Macros

If you want to learn more about lisp macros there are two great books:

* [On Lisp](https://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html) by [Paul Graham](https://www.paulgraham.com)

  The book is out of print and you can download it for free. But if you prefer printed books you can get it printed on Lulu Express.

  Here is article that explain how to do this:

* [Piecing Together a Printed Copy of "On Lisp"](https://www.lurklurk.org/onlisp/onlisp.html)

  You can also read this [discussion on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/l71amc/on_lisp_paperback_replica/).

* Antoher great book about advanced lisp macros is [Let over Lambda](https://letoverlambda.com/) by [Doug Hoyte](https://hoytech.com/).


**NOTE**: Unfortunetelly there are no good books about Scheme hygienic macros.
